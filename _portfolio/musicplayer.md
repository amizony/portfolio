The source code is available on Github: [Pong](https://github.com/amizony/music-player).


## Context

This was my first application during my apprenticeship at Bloc.io. I built it following a pre-made design and with the help of my mentor.
I build first the layout of the different page (HTML and CSS) and then wrote the app with the help of jquery.  
Then as I added more features, to keep the code well organized I used Angularjs.

The objective of this project was to discover the web development and make my first web-application.

## Features

Here is what's the application has:

* A collection of albums
* One page for each album
* The possibility to play music
* A player bar with sliders
* Some control over the songs played (volume, time, previous or next song)
* And it's a single page application
