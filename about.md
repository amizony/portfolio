I'm graduated from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](http://www.enseirb-matmeca.fr/en) (in Bordeaux - France) as Finite Element Analysis Engineer.  
After working with [EDF](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group), I looked for a new job.
During this time I improved my English proficiency by taking courses and traveling. I learned then a new language, German, in order to move in Germany (where I currently live).  

As a hobby I discovered my interest in Artificial Intelligence and learned to code. That was my firsts steps in JavaScript.
And I enjoyed it so much that I decided to learn web-development to make a work of this new passion.
I started to follow on-line tutorials or courses (like [codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) or [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/))
but wasn't plainly satisfied of what I learned until starting my apprenticeship at [Bloc.io](https://www.bloc.io/).
There I received personal coaching from an experienced mentor and could learn good coding practices.

During my Apprenticeship with Bloc.io, I gained a wide range of skills in Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and AngularJS).
Iâ€™m familiar with modern development tools such as: Git, Github, npm, Grunt, Heroku.
